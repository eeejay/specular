Specular

Description
===========

Specular is a suite of tools and libraries used for
cross-(browser|platform) testing of ARIA implementations in user
agents. Specular currently consists of the following components that
may be ditributed seperately for ease of use:

1. Speclenium
Speclenium is a server that runs along-side Selenium-RC to provide
accessibility API assertions during a Selenium automated
tests. Typically when speclenium is launched, it will start an
instance of Selenium-RC. All test target machines need to have
Speclenium running on them.

2. PyUnit Test Suite
Selenium-RC allows tests to be driven accross machine boundaries by
almost any standard unit testing framework, in any language. The test
suite bundled with Specular is written in Python, and tests for ARIA
conformance across browsers. The test suite too could be distributed 
seperateley.

Building Distribution Packages
==============================

The whole of Specular is developed in one repository and it's source
is distributed as one monolithic collection of the components
above. Nonetheless, the individual components could be packaged
seperately, and include some basic dependancies to ease
installation. The following setup.py commands should work:

1. speclenium_dist
This prepares an archive with the library and script needed to start a
Speclenium server. A Selenium-RC JAR file will be bundled with this
package, and Speclenium will launch Selenium-RC at startup.

2. speclenium_dist_win32
This prepares an executable of Speclenium for Windows. All
dependancies are included in this package, even Python.

3. tests_dist
This prepares an archive of PyUnit tests and a harness called
'run_tests'. This distribution will bundle selenium.py, which is an
external module from the Selenium project.
