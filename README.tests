Speclenium Test Suite

Prerequisites
=============
Besides the selenium module, which should be bundled with the suite,
there are no other dependancies besides Python 2.5.

The test suite consists of simple ARIA conformance PyUnit tests. The
harness is "run_tests", just run it with "--help" to see the possible
arguments.

Edit settings.ini to match your browser setup and network topography.
